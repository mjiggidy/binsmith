# binsmith

**Binsmith** creates new Avid bins.  That's it.  That's all it does.  And I didn't even write the most important part, which is the [pyavb](https://github.com/markreidvfx/pyavb) library.  So this is basically a wrapper for that.

## Why then?

Well, it's useful for batch-creating a whole bunch of bins across multiple folders and stuff in your Avid projects.  At least, that's why I made it!

## What's next?

I don't want to get too fancy, but I plan to add the ability to set a default bin view.
